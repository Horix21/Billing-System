Billing System is a tool that I made for calculating how much you're gonna need to pay after buying certain things (Tax + Tip Included)

All credits go to me : Horix21 (Slim Shadyâš¡#0590)

Update Log: 1.1. I fixed a couple of bugs, for example, the program would crash  if you would press the Tip button without anything being in the entry.
I also added a couple of other products like "Optimus Prime" and "Watermelon Juice"
This is probably gonna be last / last but one update. See ya!
